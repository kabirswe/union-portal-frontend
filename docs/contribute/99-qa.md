# Q&A

## Storybook says `Adding stories defined in ".storybook/main.js"` but there's `.storybook/main.ts`.

Actually, Storybook reads `.storybook/main.ts`. You can try to rename `.storybook/main.ts` and see Storybook
throws an error `No configuration files have been found`.

## ESLint/Stylelint doesn't report format/prettier related error.

Now Prettier official says they don't recommend to integrate Prettier with linting softwares.

https://prettier.io/docs/en/integrating-with-linters.html

We recommend to install Prettier integration to your editor.
